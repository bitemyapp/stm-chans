stm-chans
=========

In general, this is a simple package and should be easy to install.
It does require GHC however, because it relies on the
Control.Concurrent.STM.TChan type which (for some unknown reason)
is GHC-only. With the cabal-install program you can just do:

    $> cabal install stm-chans

Or if you don't have cabal-install, then you can use the Cabal
library:

    $> runhaskell Setup.hs configure
    $> runhaskell Setup.hs build
    $> runhaskell Setup.hs test
    $> runhaskell Setup.hs haddock --hyperlink-source
    $> runhaskell Setup.hs copy
    $> runhaskell Setup.hs register

The test step is optional and currently does nothing. The Haddock
step is also optional.
