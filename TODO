* Combine the test suite into a single executable and then do:
    $> darcs setpref test "runhaskell Tests.hs"

* Also, tell Setup.hs so that `cabal test` and `runhaskell Setup.hs
  test` call the test suite.

* Try to get the newest/final version of this package folded into "stm".

* Possibly incorporate more things from http://hackage.haskell.org/package/bounded-tchan
