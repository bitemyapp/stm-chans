No, but I can rebuild the benchmark... see below.

Notice the many very small atomically blocks, along with a single
reader and single writer, are perfectly designed to increase
contention if you use a single counter but don't contend at all (in
the normal case) when you use two separate counters. In other words,
this benchmark is as strongly biased toward the two-counter solution
as you'll ever see.

Cheers,
Thomas
