=== Haskell stm-chans package AUTHORS/THANKS file ===

The stm-chans package was written (predominantly) by wren gayle romano
and is released under the terms in the LICENSE file. I would also
like to give thanks to the following contributers:

Thomas DuBuisson --- For important improvements to TBChan and
    TBMChan, incorporating parts of his bounded-tchan package. These
    improvements reduce contention between readers and writers,
    improving throughput by 2--3 times when producers and consumers
    are running in separate OS threads.

kudah --- For adding TQueue support.
