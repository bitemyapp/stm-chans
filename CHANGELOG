    - Removed the deprecated compatibility modules.

2.1.0 (2013-05-29):
    - Added UNPACK pragmas everywhere to reduce indirections.
    - Added versions of newBroadcastT*Chan for TMChan
    - Deprecated all the compatibility stuff, since newBroadcastTChan requires stm >= 2.4 anyways.
2.0.0 (2013-05-12):
    - Add TQueue support

1.3.1 (2012-02-29):
    - Corrected the CPP macros now that stm-2.3 is released.

      contention between readers and writers and improving throughput
      considerably (when multiple OS threads are used).
    - Control.Concurrent.STM.TBChan: added estimateFreeSlotsTBChan,
      freeSlotsTBChan
    - Control.Concurrent.STM.TBMChan: added estimateFreeSlotsTBMChan,
      freeSlotsTBMChan
